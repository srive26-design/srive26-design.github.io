  I made this website to let you know a little about me and why I want to be an engineer. It get's better as you scroll, so please, stay until the end!

    In 8th grade, during my Living Environment class, a group of Columbia students visited and introduced us to biomedical engineering. It was the first time I had ever heard of engineering, and they taught us about prosthetics—how they work and why people rely on them. I had always done well in school, though I often felt bored, but this class immediately fascinated me.

    When the students returned, we got to design our own prosthetics, taking into account real-world factors and challenges. The process of learning about the problem, brainstorming possible solutions, applying critical thinking, and then building something that could actually improve people’s lives—it was the most exciting thing I had ever done (well, maybe second to jumping on a trampoline).

    That experience revealed something about me: I have an engineer’s mindset. I’ve always wanted to know how things work and how to make them better, and that curiosity shapes much of my life. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to study engineering.

  I think back to that lab four years ago and its memory is so clear in my mind; it’s how I know this is what I was meant to do and I never changed my mind.
